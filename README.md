# kata-bowling-game

This Kata is inspired by Uncle Bob and can be found here:

This is my first public Kata.

In this Kata I tried TDD, looked for ways to separate logic from data and used the SOLID principles.

I also wanted to learn more about Kotlin.

From time to time a will update this kata when I have new ideas how to improve this kata.

When you have any tipps feel free to tell me.
